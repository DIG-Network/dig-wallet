# Rust Wallet Implementation Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Rust wallet implementation compared to the TypeScript original, highlighting what has been implemented, what's missing, and what needs to be completed for full functionality.

## ✅ Successfully Implemented Features

### Core Wallet Structure
- **Wallet struct**: Equivalent to TypeScript `Wallet` class with `mnemonic` and `wallet_name` fields
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive `WalletError` enum with proper error types
- **Module structure**: Clean separation of concerns with `error`, `wallet`, and `file_cache` modules

### Cryptographic Operations
- **Mnemonic generation**: Using BIP39 with 256-bit entropy for 24-word mnemonics
- **Mnemonic validation**: Proper validation using `bip39` crate
- **Key derivation**: Master secret key, synthetic keys, and puzzle hash generation
- **Digital signatures**: Key ownership signature creation and verification
- **AES-256-GCM encryption**: Proper encryption/decryption for wallet data storage

### Wallet Management
- **Wallet creation**: Generate new wallets with secure mnemonic generation
- **Wallet import**: Import existing wallets from mnemonic phrases
- **Keyring storage**: Encrypted storage in `~/.dig/keyring.json`
- **Wallet listing**: Enumerate all stored wallets
- **Wallet deletion**: Remove wallets from keyring

### Data Storage
- **FileCache**: Generic file-based caching system equivalent to TypeScript version
- **Encrypted persistence**: Secure storage with AES-256-GCM encryption
- **JSON serialization**: Proper serialization/deserialization of wallet data

### Dependencies Integration
- **DataLayer-Driver**: Successfully integrated v0.1.50 from crates.io
- **BLS signatures**: Proper integration with Chia BLS signature system
- **Cryptographic libraries**: AES-GCM, BIP39, and other crypto dependencies

## ✅ Fully Implemented Features (Updated)

### Peer Integration
- **Peer connection**: Full `connect_random` implementation for mainnet/testnet
- **Coin selection**: Complete implementation using DataLayer-Driver async API
- **Coin spendability checks**: Full implementation using `is_coin_spent_rust`
- **Unspent coin queries**: Complete implementation using `get_all_unspent_coins_rust`

### Address Encoding
- **Puzzle hash to address**: Complete XCH address encoding using bech32m
- **Address to puzzle hash**: Complete address decoding functionality

### Network Operations
- **Blockchain interaction**: Full implementation with proper peer methods
- **SSL certificate handling**: Automatic detection of Chia SSL certificates
- **Multi-network support**: Both mainnet and testnet11 support

## ❌ Missing Features (Compared to TypeScript)

### Interactive Prompts
- **User input prompts**: TypeScript version has `askForMnemonicAction`, `askForMnemonicInput`
- **CLI interaction**: No equivalent to `inquirer` prompts for user interaction

### Chia Client Integration
- **Chia RPC**: No equivalent to `importWalletFromChia` method
- **Chia config reading**: Missing integration with Chia client configuration

### Advanced Wallet Features
- **Coin reservation caching**: While FileCache exists, specific coin reservation logic not implemented
- **Fee estimation**: No equivalent to TypeScript's sophisticated fee calculation
- **Address encoding**: Puzzle hash to XCH address conversion not implemented

### Configuration Management
- **NconfManager equivalent**: No direct equivalent to TypeScript's configuration management
- **Environment variables**: Missing `Environment` utilities
- **Config file management**: No equivalent to `dig.config.json` handling

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Encryption Implementation
```rust
// Proper AES-256-GCM implementation
fn encrypt_data(data: &str) -> Result<EncryptedData, WalletError>
fn decrypt_data(encrypted_data: &EncryptedData) -> Result<String, WalletError>
```

### Key Derivation Chain
```rust
// Following Chia's key derivation standards
mnemonic -> master_secret_key -> synthetic_keys -> puzzle_hash -> address
```

### Error Handling
```rust
// Comprehensive error types
pub enum WalletError {
    MnemonicRequired,
    InvalidMnemonic,
    CryptoError(String),
    NetworkError(String),
    // ... and more
}
```

## 🚀 Required Next Steps
